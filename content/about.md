Hey！🔥Welcome to Runhang's base🔥

<br>
&emsp;&emsp;I am currently a master student at [Wong lab.](http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/people-directory/adam-cn-wong/)

**Research interests**

&emsp;&emsp;We are living a microbial world where all animals are intimately associated with microbes. The animal hosts have co-evolved with the microbes inhabiting in their body (i.e. gut). While human genome is hard to edit, the gut microbial community and its collective genetic materials are easy to amend through diet (prebiotics) and probiotics (dietary beneficial microbes), providing novel tactcics to improve human health. Given the epidemic of obesity worldwide and high sugar diet-shaped gut microbiome that could alter our feeding behavior, my goal is to use *Drosophila* model to illunimate the underlying mechanisms of microbiome-mediated host physiology (e.g. nutritional state and appetite). 

&emsp;&emsp; To translate the study of experimental models into clinical practice (Lactobacillus represents a good example), we have to study microbiome ecology! Our understanding of microbiome ecology is extremely limited such as gut microbial community is composed of >1000 bacterial taxa (some fungi&virus). It remains largely unknown whether the interactions of such an intricated network are highly personalized or universal across human. Furthermore, despite the gut microbiome intrapersonal variation is smaller than that of interpersonal variation, two sets of microbiome could exert similar functions, as known as functional redundancy of microbiome. The functional redundancy of the gut microbiome adds another layer of complexity to gut microbiome ecology. There is an urgent call for multi-disciplinary collaborations in microbiome study across different systems (soil, ocean, plant, animals). On top of continuous efforts in sequencing, bacteria genome editing, and clinic trails, I believe, mathematical modeling and simulation can provide great insights about designing a personalized microbial cocktail for human health.

**Advocation**

- Transparent datasets and transparent methodology are fundamental for the advancement of science. 

- "Science not communicated is science not done" - Mellisa Marshall

We all love science and cherish that this is the greatest time to do science. Importantly, we should also TALK about science, SHARE ideas, and keep CRITICIZing.

<br>&emsp; Here, I will write more R code for data visualization and omics data analysis.

&emsp;关于生物信息，我还在探索。后期我会多写写生物领域，宏基因组，微生物组的数据分析的小文章。敬请期待～
