<p>Hey！🔥Welcome to Runhang&#39;s base🔥</p>
<p><br>
&emsp;&emsp;I am currently a master student at <a href="http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/people-directory/adam-cn-wong/">Wong lab.</a></p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;We are living a microbial world where all animals are intimately associated with microbes. The animal hosts have co-evolved with the microbes inhabiting in their body (i.e. gut). While human genome is hard to edit, the gut microbial community and its collective genetic materials are easy to amend through diet (prebiotics) and probiotics (dietary beneficial microbes), providing novel tactcics to improve human health. Given the epidemic of obesity worldwide and high sugar diet-shaped gut microbiome that could alter our feeding behavior, my goal is to use <em>Drosophila</em> model to illunimate the underlying mechanisms of microbiome-mediated host physiology (e.g. nutritional state and appetite). </p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp; To translate study of experimental models into clinical practice (Lactobacillus represent a good example), we have to study microbiome ecology! Our understanding about microbiome ecology is extremely limited such as gut microbial community is composed of &gt;1000 bacterial taxa (some fungi&amp;virus). It is remains largely unknown that whether the interactions of such an intricated network are highly personalized or universal across human. Futhermore, despite the gut microbiome intrapersonal variation is smaller than that of interpersonal varition, two sets of microbiome could exert similar functions, as known as functional redundency of microbiome. The functional redundency of gut microbiome adds another layer of complexity of gut microbiome ecology. There is urgent call for multi-disciplinary colabortions in microbiome study across different systems (soil, ocean, plant, animals). On top of continuous effors in sequencing, bacteria genome editing and clinic trails, I believe, mathematical modeling and stimulation can provide great insights about designing a personalized microbioal cocktail for human health.</p>

<p>We all love science and cherish that this is the greatest time to do science. Importantly, we should also TALK science, SHARE ideas and keep CRITICIZing.</p>
<p><br>&emsp;Here, I will write more R code for data visualiztion and omics data analysis. </p>
<h2 id="-br-br-emsp-"><br><br>&emsp;感谢🙏来访</h2>
<p>&emsp;关于生物信息，我还在探索。后期我会多写写生物领域，宏基因组，微生物组的数据分析的小文章。敬请期待～</p>
