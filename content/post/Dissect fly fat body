&emsp;&emsp;Insects store energy reserves in the form of glycogen and triglycerides in the adipocytes, the main fat body cell (Aresse and Soulages 2011). From an ecological perspective, insects which allocate more resources into lipid biosynthesis could sustain better during starvation while it may come as a cost for reduced reproduction. This ecological concept can be simplified into a central question in terms of life history strategy: invest yourself (being selfish) or invest your offspring (being selfless)? Here, I use Drosophila suzukii as my experimental model to study nutritional tradeoff betweeen starvation, development, and reproduction. I hypothezie that flies fed on high-sugar diet have greater starvation resistance owning to higher glucogen/triglycerides in the fat body than flies fed on high-protein deit. Have done the nutritional assays, the next step is to dissect the fat body and visualize the adipocytes from there.

## Step1: Pin the head and the tip of abdomen
