Insects constantly receive external cues and adjust their behavior. When the herbivorous insects target the plant,

they first reply on olfaction to approach the suitable host plants. Rejecting or accepting the plant host is then involved in

gustation and mechanosensation through direct contact. Recent studies have pointed out the gut microbiota contributes to the

host animals' chemosensory responses and behavior. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the effects of

gut microbes on the host central nervous system. Here, I will give a review of available techniques that can be applied in

insect olfaction study.

## Example

** A fantastic research paper teach you how to study olfactory system in an non-model organism -- _D.suzukii_ **

** Marianthi Karageorgi et al., 2017; Curr Biol **

### Rational:
1. First, they did a set of behavior assays that found out _D. suzukii_ prefer to lay eggs in ripe/fresh fruit over rotten fruit
