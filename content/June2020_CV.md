## EDUCATION

**M.S. Entomology and Nematology**, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA. (Aug. 2019 - present)

**B.S. Plant Protection**, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China. (Sep. 2015 – Jul. 2019)

​	*China Scholarship Council Program*, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA. (Aug. 2018 – May. 2019)

## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

**M.S. project,** ***Drosophila suzukii-microbe interactions***, *Department of Entomology and Nematology (Sep 2019 – present, Supervisor: Dr. Adam C.N. Wong)*

1. Generated germ-free and gonobiotic *D. suzukii* to exmine the microbiome effects on the host foraging behavior. 
2. Isolated *D. suzukii*-associated microbes and found the fly attraction to its gut microbes including *Pantoea agglomerans*.

**Reseach Assistant,** *Department of Entomology and Nematology of UF (Sep. 2018 – May. 2019, Supervisor: Dr. Adam C.N. Wong)*

1. Assisting in the dissection of the chironomid larvae alimentary canal while preserving the internal microbiome for further analysis. 
2. Generated germ-free *Drosophila* and selectively incorporates bacteria commonly found in the Drosophila gut in order to observe the effects these microbes have on the fly’s dietary preferences. 

**Research Assitant,** *Hubei Insect Resources Utilization and Sustainable Pest Management Key Laboratory (Dec. 2016 – Jul. 2018, Supervisor: Dr. Hu Wan)*

1. Examined the sublethal and transgenerational effects of triflumezopyrim on the developmental time, longevity, fecundity and hatchability of brown planthopper. [The results were published in journal Crop Protection](#PUBLICATION) I was responsible for writing the results and discussion sections. 
2. Discovered the brown planthopper under elevated CO<sub>2 </sub>(550mg/L) environment for over 20 generations had less susceptibility to insectcide nitenpyram, and this is accompanied with enhanced activities of detoxyflying emzyme such as P450 monooxygenases. 

## TEACHING

**Teaching Assistant, Molecular Biology of Insects and Nematodes, UF, Fall 2019.** 

1. Prepared lectures and student debate sessions.
2. Contacted and made arrangements with guest speakers.
3. Grading assignments, mid-term and final exams. 

**Direct supervisor of three undergraduate interns** 

​	**Michael Costa***, [costam@ufl.edu](mailto:costam@ufl.edu) (Sep. 2019 – present)

1. Isolated and identified five bacteria from strawberries and blueberries.
2. Examined the bacteria-derived volatile’s attractiveness/repellence to *D. suzukii*.
3. Discovered *Frigoribacterium* has a strong repellence to *D. suzukii,* providing novel strategies for *D. suzukii* management. 

​	**Lewis A. Culver**, [lewisculver@ufl.edu](mailto:lewisculver@ufl.edu) (Sep. 2019 – present)

1. Generated axenic flies for behavioral experiment.
2. Colony maintenance.

​	**Tiffany L. Royle**, [tiffanyroyle@ufl.edu](mailto:tiffanyroyle@ufl.edu) (Sep. 2019 – present)

1. Created a recipe of making fruit-based diet for rasing *D. suzukii* colony. 
2. Helped me set up the experimental arenas.

## EXTENSION EXPERIENCE

**“Contribution to Beautiful China’s Village” social work internship, leader of the team (Jun 9 - 16, 2017)**

1. Organized a service trip to five remote villages located near Wuhan, China.
2. Visited with and discussed important issues concerning the local villagers, farmers, agricultural company management, and the local governor.
3. Drafted a report detailing potential flaws in the development of China’s villages while providing reasonable suggestions for improvement.
4. Produced, filmed, and edited a press release about this internship experience to be displayed on the campus website.

**Dabie Mountain Internship (Aug 19 - 26, 2017)**

1. I lead a team of five students as we set up light traps in order to collect a variety of insects on Dabie Mountains, a major mountain range located in central China.
2. We were able to collect hundreds of insects spanning over 100 genera in 12 orders. We then preserved these specimens for teaching in Entomology course.
